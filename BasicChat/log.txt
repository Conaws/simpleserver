        Long Polling
            (=) Simple technique for reading data from a server

            Steps?
                1. The client browser makes a normal request
                2. The browser does not respond until new information is available
                3. Once the new information is available it is sent to the client
                4. The client then does something with the data
                5. Then starts a new long poll

            The client always keeps one long polling request open to the server and gets new data as it is available.


            Needs?
                1. Some sort of data payload
                    (exp = )A chat message
               
                2. Some way of knowing which messages are new to the client
                    (exp =) A counter to know what messages are new


            {} Cases to handle?
                New messges are available as the server polls

        I was not initating the first Poll in the javascript on index.html, thus I was able to log certain messages but the jquery was never being called to add them to the textarea on the page. 

        Now it's working

    Problem: Chat server is not serving chats (10 minutes)
        Identified: 10:30:59
        Hypothosis:
            Moved server into a new file system, might have lost some dependencies, not remembering to start this up.

        Solution:

            This version of the chat server sends messages using the /msg/.... url, the request url is what gets sent to all the other clients who are listening to the server via long polling. 

            To run this, first run the server using node server.js, then visit port 8080 (or whatever is being listened to on the server.js page), then send messages by using localhost:8080/msg/send this message
            it will not redirect to the chat page following the send.

    Challenge: Implement a Form which sends POST requests for you.

    Challenge: This is super buggy
